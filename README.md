# Codefundo-2019
We intend to make a Web App which can make voting less troublesome, more secure, reliable using Blockchain Technology.

Our app name will be <B>"Secure My Vote"</B> which will work as follows:

1><b><U>Registration of Voters</b></U>
Once Voter registration agency determines that someone is eligible to vote, they would receive a token that would allow them to cast their vote exactly once. This ensures that the double-spending problem doesn't exist and hence getting rid of the double voting problem as well as ensuring full security. User can also receive their token for a vote by uploading the photo of their voter id card to a server through an app which will be verified using image processing and text processing.

2><b><U>Decentralised Voting system</b></U> The whole process of casting vote is decentralized and hence ensure the security of election as no single agency is responsible for conducting the election. Anybody can participate as long as they are eligible. These ensure that the system is available throughout election and votes are counted correctly.

3><b><U>Preventing Redundancy of voters vote </b></u>is recorded one time using a token for the specific candidate they want and placed into the candidate’s account and permanently recorded on the Blockchain.
  
4><b><U>Preventing Manipulation of Votes</b></U>By using blockchain to permanently record each vote, this app ensures that there can be no manipulation of those votes or voting twice. 

5><b><U>Voice of People Feature</b></U>The APP has also built-in additional capabilities that allow for people to voice their opinions on various topics, enhancing the “voice of the people” approach of the app.

6> <b><U>Introduction of AI bots</b></U> : These bots can help to ban the person from hacking into an app and also restrict a user to cast multiple votes if they try to forge their details and get multiple tokens and cast illegal votes which are the scenario in the present election system.

7><b><U>User-Friendly UI along with multiple languages and audio support</b></U> for the physically challenged person and can guide to cast their vote securely without any trouble
